>"By serendipity, we found that fluorescently tagged wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that binds specifically to sialic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, labeled migrasomes in living cells. Moreover, fluorescence intensity analysis showed that the WGA signal on migrasomes was much higher than the WGA signal on retraction fibers, indicating that WGA prefers to bind to migrasomes. Finally, WGA effectively labeled migrasomes in all the cell lines we tested. Thus [fluorescently tagged WGA can be used as a probe for migrasomes](https://github.com/LiYuLab/figures-for-liyu-lab-page/raw/master/protocols/WGA%20is%20a%20probe%20for%20migrasomes.pdf)."
