>"TSPAN4 and integrin are known to be enriched on migrasomes. However, both proteins are also present on exosomes, making it difficult to distinguish the two structures biochemically based only on detection of these proteins. Imaging is the only approach for confirming the presence of migrasomes, but it is not compatible with most clinical samples."

>"Western blotting results showed that four proteins, NDST1 (bifunctionalheparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1),
PIGK (phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class K), CPQ (carboxypeptidase Q) and EOGT (EGF domainspecific O-linked N-acetylglucosaminetransferase), were [enriched in migrasomes, but were absent or barely detectable in exosomes](https://github.com/LiYuLab/figures-for-liyu-lab-page/raw/master/protocols/Identification%20of%20markers%20for%20migrasome%20detection.pdf)."
