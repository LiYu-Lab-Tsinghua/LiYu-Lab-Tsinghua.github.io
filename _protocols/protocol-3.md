# Isolation of migrasomes from tissue culture cells

The isolation procedure was based on a modification of previous protocols (Ma et al, 2014). Briefly, cells were grown in 150mm dishescoated with 0.1 μg/ml fibronectin in full DMEM medium for 12 hours. A batch of purification requires 30-80dishes. The cells and migrasomes on plateswere digested with trypsin and collected in 50ml tubes. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4°C. Cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min followed by 4000g for 20 min. Crude migrasomes were then collected as the pellet by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min. The crude migrasome pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged down again at 20,000 g for 30min. Migrasome fractionation was performed by density gradient centrifugation, using Optiprep as the density medium (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556). First, a step gradient was built starting with 30%(500 μl), followed by 25%(500 μl), crude migrasomes (19%, 500 μl), 15%(500 μl), 12%(500 μl), 10%(500 μl), 8%(500 μl), 5%(500 μl) and 2%(500 μl). The crude migrasome sample was prepared by first resuspending the pellet with 137.5 μl dilution buffer and then mixing with 400 μl 1ⅹextraction buffer and 252.5 μl 60% Optiprep. Second, the prepared gradient was centrifuged at 150 000× g for 4 hr at 4°C in an MLS-50 rotor (Beckman). Third, samples were collected from top to bottom (480 μl per fraction). Each fraction was mixed with the same volume of PBS (480 μl) and centrifuged at 20,000g for 30min to collect the pellet. The pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged again at 20,000g for 30min. The samples were compatible with western blot analysis, TEM, cryo-EM and mass spectrometry.

# Isolation of migrasomes from serum samples

Blood samples of normal donors for research purposes werecollected in 6-ml procoagulation vacuum tubes using standard venepuncture protocols. Human serum was withdrawn from the tube for the purification procedures. A total of 50ml of cell-free serum was required for one batch purification. Large debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min followed by 4000g for 20 min. Crude migrasomes were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min, then washed with PBS. Migrasome fractionation was performed by Iodixanol-sucrose density gradient centrifugation, using Optiprep (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556) as the density medium. First, a step gradient was built starting from 30%(500 μl), followed by 25%(500 μl), 19% (500 μl), 15%(500 μl), 12%(500 μl), 10%(500 μl), 8%(500 μl), and 5%(500 μl). The sample (500 μl) was prepared in 2%Optiprep and layered on top. The gradient was centrifuged at 150 000× g for 4 hr at 4°C in an MLS-50 rotor(Beckman). Samples were collected from top to bottom (480 μl per fraction).Eachfraction was mixed with the same volume of PBS (480 μl), thencentrifuged at 20,000g for 30min. The migrasome pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged again at 20,000g for 30min. The samples were compatible with western blot analysis, TEM, cryo-EM and mass spectrometry.
