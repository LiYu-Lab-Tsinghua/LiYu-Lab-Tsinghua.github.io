Our lab [discovered migrasome](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014135) in 2015, a vesicular organelle that forms on retraction fibres behind migrating cells. On seeing the exquisite morphology of migrasomes attached to retraction fibres, we cannot help being engaged in deciphering mechanisms underlying [migrasome formation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-019-0367-5). More importantly, the considerable volume compared to other extracellular vesicles and characteristic ability to store the spatial information make migrasome an ideal relay for [cell-to-cell communication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-019-0358-6). In addition, more and more evidence suggests the pivotal roles of migrasomes in oncology, immunology, angiogenesis, organelle quality control and therapeutic delivery.
